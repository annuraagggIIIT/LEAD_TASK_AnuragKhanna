# Bouncing Ball Game

This is a simple JavaScript game where a ball bounces around the canvas. The ball has a pattern and changes its direction when it hits the canvas boundaries. You can also click on the canvas to move the ball to the clicked position and increase the bounce count.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the canvas to move the ball to the clicked position.
3. Observe the ball bouncing off the canvas boundaries.
4. The bounce count is displayed at the top-left corner of the canvas.

## Code Overview

The game is implemented using HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are the key components:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: Provides basic styling for the canvas and buttons.
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic, including ball movement, pattern drawing, and bounce counting.

## How to Run
